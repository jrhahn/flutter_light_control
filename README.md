# Light Control

This is a client application that interacts with the [Pico Pi dimmer](https://github.com/jrhahn/pico_pi_dimmer). The app allows the user to set up an arbitrary number of endpoints (Pico Pi). Once configured, the brightness of the LED stripes can easily adjusted by moving a slider.

The app is built with flutter. Hence, it is easy to build a web-based, iOS or Android version.

I have not tested yet if it is compatible with [Pico Pi dimmer v2](https://github.com/jrhahn/pico_pi_dimmer_v2). The required changes, if any, should be straight forward.
